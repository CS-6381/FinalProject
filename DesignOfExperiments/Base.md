# Base Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to understand when the technology is viable to use. 

## Compatibility 
Here we wish to understand where the tech is easily used

### Qualitative 
Add all qualitative data here

### Basic Information
- How many individual actors can connect to this system at one time? 
- What license does it operate under?
- How much must be paid to use this technology?
    - One time fee?
    - Monthly?
    - Yearly?
- Does it have explicit enterprise support?
