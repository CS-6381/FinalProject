|**Website(s)**| <ul><li>{1} location for all IPFS documentation [https://docs.ipfs.io](https://docs.ipfs.io) <li>{2} GitHub repository for IPSF Desktop [https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop) 
|**Overview Basics**    | Peer-to-Peer Hypermedia Protocol
|**Implementation Basics**     | <li>{1} Command-Line Quick Start Reference [https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/#take-your-node-online](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/#take-your-node-online) <li>{2} CLI API [https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/cli/#ipfs](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/cli/#ipfs) 
|**Use Cases**      | <li>{1} As a mounted global filesystem, under /ipfs and /ipns. <li>{2} As a mounted personal sync folder that automatically versions, publishes, and backs up any writes. <li>{3} As an encrypted file or data sharing system. <li>{4} As a versioned package manager for all software. <li>{5} As the root filesystem of a Virtual Machine. <li>{6} As the boot filesystem of a VM (under a hypervisor). <li>{7} As a database: applications can write directly to the Merkle DAG data model and get all the versioning, caching, and distribution IPFS provides. <li>{8} As a linked (and encrypted) communications platform. <li>{9} As an integrity checked CDN for large files (without SSL). <li>{10} As an encrypted CDN. <li>{11} On webpages, as a web CDN. <li>{12} As a new Permanent Web where links do not die.
|**Features**      | <li>{1} Decentralized sharing of files (P2P). <li>{2} Cryptographic hash node IDs (both a public and private ID), <li>{3} Can use any transport protocol. <li>{4} Use of DHTs (based on S/Kademlia and Coral) <li>{5} Data distribution through block exchange using their novel BitSwap protocol (inspirired by BitTorrent) <li>{6} Utilzies a Merkle DAG to link objects that have unique cryptographic hashes that allow for content addressing, tamper resistance, and deduplication. <li>{7} a set of objects for modeling a versioned filesystem on top of the Merkle DAG very similar to Github. <li>{8} Mutable naming.
|**Scalability**     |Highly Scalable
|**Goals**   | <li>{1} Hosting/Distributing large (Petabyte) datasets. <li>{2} Computing on large data across companies <li>{3} High Volume or high definition on-demand or realtime media streams. <li>{4} versioning and linking  of massive datasets. <li>{5} Low latency and decentralized file system distribution.
