| **Website(s)** | (1) location for all documentation [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/) <br/> (2) GitHub repository for IPSF Desktop [https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html](https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html) |

| **Overview Basics** | Distributed File System |

| **Implementation Basics** | Quick Start [https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html) <br/> |
| **Use Cases** | (1) Finance Sector: risk modelling. <br/> (2) Healthcare Sector: traking of large scale health index and metrics for curing diseases, reducing medical cost, predicting and managing epidemics and maintaining the quality of human life. <br/> (3) Telecom Industry: saving very large number of records frequently, for example, 30 Terabytes per month. <br/> (4) Retail Sector: Any large scale retailer doing transactional data analysis needs to put together massive quantities of Point of Sale transaction data coming from various data sources, with an objective of predicting demand, increasing profit and creating targeted marketing and promotional campaigns. <br/> (5) Building Recommendation System. <br/> |

| **Features** | (1) Scalability. <br/> (2) Fault Tolerance. <br/> (3) High Availability. <br/> (4) Distributed Storage. <br/> (5) Data Reliability. <br/> (6) Replication. <br/> |

| **Scalability** | Highly Scalable |

| **Goals** | (1) Fast recovery from hardware failures. Because one HDFS instance may consist of thousands of servers, failure of at least one server is inevitable. <br/> (2) Access to streaming data. <br/> (3) Accommodation of large data sets. <br/> (4) Portability. <br/> |
