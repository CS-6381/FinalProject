# Redis
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis)

It is written in ANSI C. The development of Redis is sponsored by Redis Labs today; before that, it was sponsored by Pivotal and VMware. According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com, Redis is the most popular key-value store. [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)


## Compatibility 

While Redis is most known for its NoSQL capabilities, it also provides an implementation of the Pub/Sub paradigm. Redis can also be used as a message bus.

### Basic Information
- How many individual actors can connect to this system at one time?
  - According to benchmarks, 100,000 users can connect to a single instance of Redis per second.
  - Redis also provides clustering, which might lower the amount of throughput due to message copying. 
- What license does it operate under?
  - It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license.
- How much must be paid to use this technology?
    - One time fee?
